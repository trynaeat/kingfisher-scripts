# Kingfisher Scripts

Here you'll find all of the lua code to manage the screens in the Kingfisher creation. There are also a few common lib sort of scripts that aren't used directly in the final creation but are copy/pasted around where necessary.

All of the scripts are unminified with comments. You need to minify them before they'll fit in the 4KB stormworks limit using a tool such as https://mothereff.in/lua-minifier.

`util/` directory also contains a python script I hacked together to turn gifs into a string representation for playback in stormworks. I ended up not actually doing much with it.. but potentially cool for other projects.
